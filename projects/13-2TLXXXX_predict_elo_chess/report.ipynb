    "### Predicting Player Elo from Opening Moves\n",
    "\n",
    "**Project Overview:**\n",
    "The aim of this project is to leverage the Lichess Standard Rated Games dataset to predict a player’s Elo rating based solely on the first *n* moves of a game. By focusing on opening patterns, we seek to identify which early-game features correlate most strongly with player strength. Our hypothesis posits that stronger players adhere more closely to established opening theory, resulting in measurable patterns in their early moves.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data Source:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Dataset:** Lichess Standard Rated Games (Huggingface)\n",
    "* **Format:** Parquet files organized by year/month (≈20–30 GB per month)\n",
    "* **Key Fields:** `UTCDate`, `UTCTime`, `White`, `Black`, `WhiteElo`, `BlackElo`, `movetext`, `ECO`, `Termination`, `TimeControl`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pipeline Overview:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Extraction:** Stream only relevant Parquet shards; filter incomplete or abnormal games.\n",
    "2. **Feature Engineering:** Parse `movetext` for move sequences, evaluations, centipawn deltas, board‐state summaries (e.g., piece development, pawn structure), and accuracy metrics.\n",
    "3. **Modeling:** Train classification models (Random Forest, SVM) to predict Elo decile (binned into ten categories).\n",
    "4. **Evaluation:** Assess via accuracy, precision/recall/F₁, and interpret feature importances.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "## 2. Data Loading and Exploration\n",

    "* Presence of `[%eval ...]` annotations in `movetext`\n",
    "* At least 4 full moves\n",
    "* Time control exactly `600+0`\n",

    "\n",
    "## 6. Results\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Predictive Power of Openings:** Early move patterns, especially mistakes and evaluation swings in the first 25–100 plies, meaningfully differentiate player strength.\n",
    "* **Game Termination:** Whether a game ended by resignation, checkmate, or other methods emerged as the single most informative categorical feature.\n",
    "* **Model Limitations:** Overall accuracy remains modest (\\~20%), indicating that opening moves alone capture only part of the variability in Elo.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 7. Discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Interpretation:** Strong players exhibit more stable engine evaluations across opening moves and fewer early mistakes. Length of game and termination also reflect skill differences.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Limitations:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Analysing only 230k games from the first days of one month may underrepresent rarer high- or low-rated patterns.\n",
    "  * Exclusion of mid- and endgame features overlooks information beyond the opening.\n",
    "  * Binning Elo into deciles simplifies continuous ratings but may lose granularity.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Extensions:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Incorporate sequence models (e.g., HMMs or LSTMs) on SAN moves.\n",
    "  * Expand to regression framing for predicting continuous Elo.\n",
    "  * Integrate additional metadata (player country, time-of-day patterns).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 8. Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "This project demonstrates that opening moves contain measurable signals of player strength, as evidenced by our classification models. While opening features alone yield modest predictive accuracy, they highlight critical aspects—evaluation stability, mistake timing, and termination style—that distinguish player skill levels. Further work incorporating richer game phases and advanced sequence modeling is warranted.\n",
